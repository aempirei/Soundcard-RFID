You will need the following things:

A function generator that can do 115khz sinewave output.

A soundcard that can sample at 125khz 16bit mono.

Audacity

And the following schematic:

                        L1        C1
 115khz SINEWAVE >-----nnnn---+---||-----| GND
                              |
                              +----------| LINE-IN

   C1 - 22pf capacitor
	L1 - 16uH inductor

This schematic is very minimal and may be prone to issues
but generally the LC resonator circuit should be tuned to
about 115khz or so as I had better success with a slightly
slower signal to the inductor and sample slightly above
this at the soundcard.

Now you will have to sort of adjust the function generator
gain a lil at first just so you can get a decent sampling
at the soundcard. The next thing you may notice is that
the soundcard may have a relatively lower RMS than you expect
but were not concerned about absolute power.

Also, visually you may not be able to see the data in
its analog form very easily if at all because it relies on
a very small variance in the FSK frequencies.

From here just record the data with audacity at 125khz if
you can, save it out to a 16-bit mono WAV file and then
run it through process.sh after building the few programs.

Now you should find a 16-bit 5 digit number on the back
of your card and this should show up in the decoded binary.
